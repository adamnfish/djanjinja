DjanJinja uses an example Django project as its tests. There are tests
for both Django v1.2 and Django v1.3 to make sure it works for both.

The `setup.sh` file will set the test environment, installing
dependencies where necessary. This is the recommended way of running
the tests but there is no reqson you have to use it. It will create a
separate virtual environment for each version of the project to
isolate the tests from each other and from your system.

Running the tests is as simple as running the tests suites for both
projects but there is a helper shell script included to wrap this
behaviour.
